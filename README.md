# AddList - Learning to use FlatList
This React Native project demonstrates a basic functionality: adding items to a FlatList component by clicking a button. It serves as a fundamental example for managing dynamic lists in React Native applications.

#Description
This project showcases a simple use case:
The app starts with an empty list.
When you click the "Add box to list" button, a new item (box) is added to the list with a unique key.
The FlatList component automatically updates to display the new item.
